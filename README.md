# Sparta Data 249 ~⚙~ Final Project 


For our final project, we've created an ETL pipeline to ingest, transform, and input fictional Sparta Global data into a database which provides a single person view.

#  Methodology

We followed Agile methodology and a Scrum framework to carry out this project, using  a Trello board to prioritise work and map out user stories.

The data are loaded into a SQL database which is normalised to third normal form. Creating an Entity Relation Diagram was an important preliminary step in the pipeline process, which enabled us to plan our data manipulation and write our scripts.

## How to Run and Install

In order to run the pipeline, it is first necessary to set up the database in a SQL server such as Azure Data Studio or Microsoft SQL Server. The script to create the database is provided in the config file. This should be run, and the database structure set up before the pipeline script can be deployed.
